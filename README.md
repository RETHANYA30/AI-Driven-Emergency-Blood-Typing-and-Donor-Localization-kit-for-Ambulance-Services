### Identifying blood groups is crucial in emergency situations, and current image processing technologies offer rapid and reliable results. We propose an advanced system for accurate and swift blood group identification using cutting-edge image processing technology, integrated with an emergency kit. This system not only classifies blood groups with high precision but also enhances functionality through the integration of a GPS module for real-time tracking and a cloud-based database to store blood bank and donor information. A radius-based search algorithm locates nearby resources based on GPS location, while a map visualization library and API integration ensure seamless access to updated information. Combining fast image processing with sophisticated location-based services and an emergency kit, this system provides a reliable solution for critical blood group identification needs.
